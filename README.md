# UFO Sightings

<b>

## Background: 

Dana, who is a data journalist from McMinnville, Oregon wants us to create and customize a webpage that will allow users to interact with the data she has collected around UFO sightings in her hometown. 

<b/>

## Project Overview:

<b>

`HTML` and `JavaScript` were used to create an interactive webpage that allows users to parse the given data around UFO sightings. `CSS` and `Bootstrap` were used to modify the aesthetics of the webpage and give the user an interactive and responsive experience. Our data was provided in a Javascript array located in the `data.js` file. Using javascript's ability to manipulate data, filters were added allowing for user input regarding date, city, state, country, and shape to refine the results.

## Methodology:

A `storyboard` was used as a kind of blueprint for our site which helped with the transition from idea to finished product.

<br>

A `"Filter Search"` ability was added to our page, which gave the user the ability to refine the results that were returned from the data table.

The image below provides an example of how to filter your search. We wanted UFO sightings in California and in the shape of a triangle. The returned results were filtered by our inputs. All filter inputs are case-sensitive and require lower-case and proper spelling.

# Final Result:

The Final result is a fully operative webpage equipped with a title, text, Images, and a table with five fully functional filters that allow users to interact with the data visualizations.

## Summary:

#### Drawbacks:

- The Filter Search is strictly `case-sensitive` and does not work if typed in upper-case.
- This dataset Dana gave us is from 2010 and is outdated.

#### Further Improvement:

- The Filter Search could have been a drop down menu versus an input box to limit spelling or case-related errors. Although the filter would yield the same results, it would provide the user with a more intuitive experience.
- Providing a `click-button` for each filter as we seen when adding the first filter would help when parsing through the sightings data. The functionality of our Filter Search wouldn't change but it would improve how the user interacts with it.
