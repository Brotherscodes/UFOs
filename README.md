# UFOs

## Project Overview:

Using HTML and JavaScript to create an interactive webpage that allows users to parse the data around UFO sightings. Two things were built: the webpage that will allow users to view the data (HTML) and a dynamic table that will present it (JavaScript).

## A `storyboard` serves as a kind of blueprint for your site and helps with the transition from idea to finished product
