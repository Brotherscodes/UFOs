# UFO Sightings

<b>

## Background: 

Dana, who is a data journalist from McMinnville, Oregon wants us to create and customize a webpage that will allow users to interact with the data she has collected around UFO sightings in her hometown. 

<b/>

## Project Overview:

<b>

`HTML` and `JavaScript` were used to create an interactive webpage that allows users to parse the given data around UFO sightings. `CSS` and `Bootstrap` were used to modify the aesthetics of the webpage and give the user an interactive and responsive experience. Our data was provided in a Javascript array located in the `data.js` file. Using javascript's ability to manipulate data, filters were added allowing for user input regarding date, city, state, country, and shape to refine the results.

First A `storyboard` was used as a kind of blueprint for our site and helps with the transition from idea to finished product.
